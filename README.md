# 🖥️ Interactive Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to my **interactive terminal-style portfolio** — a fun, developer-centric way to explore who I am, what I’ve worked on, and how to get in touch. Built to feel like a command-line interface, this portfolio is designed with minimalism, responsiveness, and curiosity in mind.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a personal portfolio presented through an interactive terminal UI. Users can type commands like `about`, `projects`, `experience`, and `contact` to explore different sections — offering a unique and engaging way to showcase skills and experience.
