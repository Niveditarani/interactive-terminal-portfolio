# 🖥️ Interactive Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to my **interactive terminal-style portfolio** — a fun, developer-centric way to explore who I am, what I’ve worked on, and how to get in touch. Built to feel like a command-line interface, this portfolio is designed with minimalism, responsiveness, and curiosity in mind.
